<p>API security is really just a subset of web application security.  There are a few specific things we need to 
think about in the contect of API's.</p>

<p>API's generally authenticate users using a secret.  It is critical that the secret be tied to a user or subject.  
A good way to think about it is that you want to have a "user" and a "password".  These would come from "API KEY" and 
"Secret".  This allows us to tie requests to a user and change the password.
</p>

<p>API's sometimes seem invisible.  They are not.  Authorization is critical in API's.  Additionally, rate limiting 
can be an important consideration.  Metrics can be extremely helpful in identifying patterns of misuse.

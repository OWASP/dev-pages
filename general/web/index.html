<p>Web Application security is a huge field but there are some especially important common concepts.</p>

<p>Perhaps the single most important web security concern has to do with what code gets executed in a browser.
Applications that do not properly encode data for the browser can inadvertently allow attackers to run 
arbitrary code through cross site scripting vulnerabilities.  No matter what language or framework you are
working in, if you are building a web application you should familiarize yourself with the idea behind
cross site scripting and ensure that your application takes the fundamental steps to avoid it by 
encoding output.
</p>

<p>What is output encoding?  Output encoding is the difference between a less than sign: &lt; and the beginning of a
tag, for example:  &lt;script&gt;.  What we want is for the browser to <strong>render</strong> the less than sign.
What we do not want is for the browser to treat the less than sign as a signal that code is present and <strong>evaluate
</strong> it.  Note that encoding rules are complicated and may be different depending on where in the document you are 
(HTML attribute versus body).</p>

<p>Browser are in the party.  Browsers have the ability to help us protect ourselves from malicious code and some other 
types of security problems if we ask them properly.  This is where security related HTTP Headers come in.  By passing
security headers we signal to the browser how we want to treat the content of the page.

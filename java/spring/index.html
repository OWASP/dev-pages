<p>Spring provides significant security capabilities that developers can leverage to improve the security of applications.</p>

<p>For <strong>web applications</strong>, recent Spring releases make it easy to set browser headers that enable security.
Simply use a SecurityContext and the defaults are sound as of Spring 4.  Here are some exmaples illustrating how to use 
Spring to set browser security headers:  </p>

<p>Spring also provides authentication through Spring security which can be wired into a variety of identity providers.  As 
a general rule, this is recommended.  One pitfall with Spring security configuration is accidentally leaving resources
unprotected - in other words, having the rules that allow access be too permissive.</p>

<p>Authorization is really hard to get right or set out a stable model that will work across different use cases.  Spring
provides function level access control (A7) through annotations to controllers or services.  It is recommended that a style 
and approach be adopted and used consistently throughout the application.</p>

<p>Spring also provides instnace based authorization (A4) through ORM lifecycle events.  Instance based security is what 
ensures that a user can only see <strong>their</strong> timesheet and not someone else's.</p>

<p>As a general rule, unless the application is using ThymeLeaf, Java/JSP applications can be susceptible to XSS (A3).  It is
recommended that all output be encoded using a library level function to ensure that user input doesn't get sent to the
browser in a way that will be executed.</p>

<p>Spring and Jasypt provide a relatively straightforward way to prevent committing sensitive information like database
credentials to source control.  This is recommended.</p>

<p>Spring pulls a large number of dependent libraries, so it is recommended that a tool such as OWASP's Dependency Check
be used to identify vulnerabilities in dependent libraries.  Also, committing to updating libraries and dependencies is
important in this ecosystem.
</p>

<p>Most applications written with Spring use JDBCTemplate or Hibernate for persistence.  Note that these do not universally
protect from SQL Injection, though they generally encourage safer practices.  Always use parameterized queries and ensure
that String concatenation is not happening with queries.
</p>

<p>Spring MVC provides an easy and clear place to perform input validation (Validators).  Use input validation and 
prefer whitelists.
